### Key Sections Explained

#### **Overview and Setup**
- Provides a concise project summary and clear instructions to get started, assuming minimal setup since it’s a single-file game.

#### **Features and Controls**
- Lists all implemented features (e.g., power-ups, customizable canvas) and how to interact with the game on different devices.

#### **Algorithms Explained**
- **Ball Movement**: Simple physics with velocity reflection for boundaries.
- **Collision Detection**: Uses AABB for efficiency; paddle collisions adjust ball angle for playability.
- **Power-ups**: Combines falling mechanics with timed or instant effects.
- **Level Progression**: Checks brick status to trigger level-ups.
- **Canvas Scaling**: Adjusts resolution and font sizes dynamically to prevent blurriness.

Each algorithm includes its purpose, code snippet, and time complexity to give insight into the game’s logic and performance.

#### **Domain Suggestions**
- Pulled from the previous response, offering a mix of subdomain and standalone options.

#### **Potential Enhancements**
- Suggests practical next steps to improve the game without overcomplicating the current version.
